			<h3>why this project</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="box">
			<p>
			Users who are blind or visually impaired use mobile websites and apps to shop online. Many users rely on websites and apps to be developed to support accessibility, allowing screen reader software to read the page out loud to the user. <span class="thicker">However, many times navigational page elements are not coded to include the right tags, and websites and apps can be overly reliant on dynamic frameworks</span>, without considering how screen readers will interpret the results.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
		<p>
			When websites and apps are built without accessibility in mind, the results can leave users of screen readers without options. <span class="thicker">Ultimately, many users abandon their tasks</span> as they feel asking others to help them robs them of their sense of independence and causes them to be a burden on others.

			<h3>what we did</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<p>
			A <span class="thicker">streamlined cognitive walkthrough examines a specific task</span>, step-by-step with a target user in mind to determine the cognitive load a user will epxerience when completing tasks.
		</p>

		<h5>our process</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>Starting with <span class="thicker">creating a Persona</span>, our team had a target user to consider.</li>
			<li>We <span class="thicker">selected a core task</span> from within the app, one that represnted a common task.</li>
			<li>We broke our task down to the step level</li>
			<li>We then asked two question of each step as we <span class="thicker">performed the task</span>.</li>
				<ul class="">
				<li>Will the user know what to do at this step?</li>
				<li>If the user does the right thing, will they know that they did the right thing, and are making progress toward their goal?</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Record findings, analyze to determine successes and failures</li>
			<li>Determine the <span class="thicker">most appropriate recommendations for improvement</span> with consideration to all users of the app</li>

			<h3>what we found</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h5>Findings</h5>
			<p>
				The cognitive walkthrough resulted in <span class="thicker">12 findings</span>, each with their own recommendations.
			</p>
			<h6>a few examples</h6>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="thicker">Filter by color</span> - Voiceover reads the filter <span class="thicker">icon on the header as "button"</span> and not the label of "filter".</li>
				<li><span class="thicker">Filter by color</span> - Inside the color menu, Voiceover <span class="thicker">reads each color icon as "button"</span>, not allowing Voiceover to identify the actual color for the user. (see image for detail)</li>
				<li><span class="thicker">Filter by price</span> - The price filter uses a slider that Voiceover <span class="thicker">reads as "price $0 $600"</span>, and not control's useful label.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Recommendations</h5>
			<p>
				We identified recommendations to help correct the for the issues we encountered.
			</p>
			<h6>a few examples</h6>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="thicker">Alt text and labels</span> - using alt text and control labels allows screen readers to provide accurate content to the user.</li>
					<li><span class="thicker">Sliders</span> - Avoid using sliders for option selection as they are usually innaccessible to screen readers and require precision, something that may be difficult for those with certain motor disabilities.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				See the report for all findings and recommendations

			<h3>my reflection</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<p>
			Supporting accessibility within software was new for me, but 	<span class="thicker">the experience has highlighted for me the importance of inclusivity within the products I build</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				As part of this project, <span class="thicker">I researched how blind and visually impaired users engage with screen reader software</span> to navigate the web. I came across inspirational stories and learned about what technology meant in the life of a blind user, and specifically how using a mobile device brought new opportunities to simultaneously connect and experience independence.
			</p>
			<p>
			One of those stories was from Joy Ross, a blind YouTuber who lost her sight in her 20s. On her channel, Joy shares her experiences using tech, and in the video clip included, Joy shares what it meant for her as she used her iPhone for the first time. Joy reflects on the moment sending that first text message, she remembers crying, going on to explain how her phone has helped her feel like a normal part of society and the world.
		</p>
		<p>
			In her words, <span class="thicker">her phone has become her eyes, transforming her life and giving her back the freedom she once lost, all because she can participate in the things others are doing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
			Earlier in the video Joy talks about her experience on a popular social media site. In one experience, a feature allowing her to see engagement from her followers changed, and apparently leaving her screen reader without the ability to read "likes", and Joy without the ability to get feedback from her followers; an obvious source of connection for her.
