			Our team’s goal was to leverage  <span class="thicker">user-centered design</span> to deliver a <span class="thicker">prototype of a digital notebook app</span>. During this  <span class="thicker">6 month effort</span>, our team exceeded our client’s expectations as we provided  <span class="thicker">hand-off documentation and investor pitch materials</span> to support engaging donors to fund development and deployment to make INK into a working app.

			<h4>Monterey Bay Aquarium (MBA)</h4>
		<p>
			Monterey Bay Aquarium is a <span class="thicker">world-renowned institution dedicated to inspiring conservation of the ocean.</span> Since opening in 1984, the Aquarium has become a destination for millions of visitors while becoming a leader and educator in ocean conservation.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the opening of the Bechtel Education Center in 2019, STEM education is a clear focus of the Aquarium’s future. The new Center is a space for learning that is geared towards <span class="thicker">supporting students and teachers with innovation and learning opportunities both in the lab and out at the tidepools.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			Loaded with wide open workspaces, cubbies for collaboration and a center created to showcase technologies normally hidden away, the Bechtel Education Center was completed in 2018. The center gives students a place to learn about ocean conservation while developing skills in the scientific research process.

	<h3 id="req">problem / client requirements</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="box">
		<p>
			As a student in an education program at Monterey Bay Aquarium, <span class="thicker">learning happens in the lab, at the tidepools and back in their regular classrooms</span>. With no single app representing a complete solution, <span class="thicker">students use a variety of apps, paper worksheets and non-digital tools</span> while working on assignments, <span class="thicker">causing inefficiencies</span> that could be resolved with a single app-based solution.
		</p>
		<p>
		</p>
			<h5>Challenges we Discovered</h5>
			<ul>
			<li>Physically <span class="thicker">transporting dozens of paper-based notebooks</span> by teachers for feedback and grading was difficult and <span class="thicker">caused delays to timely feedback</span>.</li>
			<li><span class="thicker">Converting physical / paper materials</span> to online formats was time-consuming and <span class="thicker">limited sharing and collaboration opportunities</span>.</li>
			<li>Referencing (Reflecting) past observations and insights is difficult due to the physical limitations around storage and on-demand access.</li>
			<li><span class="thicker">Inequity due to inconsistent access</span> to technology and wi-fi by students outside of the classroom.</li>
			<li><span class="thicker">Multiple technology platforms means more work for teachers</span> who need to learn platforms to support students.</li>
			</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="box">
		<h5>Client Requirements</h5>
		<p>
		Upon engagement, our team received requirements developed by MBA education staff. While the requirements were well-informed from their experience, our client was also <span class="thicker">interested in what our user-centered process would reveal</span>. This allowed the team to move forward with guidance, but few constraints on where our process might take us.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="thicker">Some of the requirements were</span>
		</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Content creation (<span class="thicker">typing, drawing, writing, photos, videos, audio</span>)</li>
			<li>Access anywhere (classroom, home, field)</li>
			<li><span class="thicker">Organization to support reflection and reference</span></li>
			<li>Feedback & assessment (teachers & peers)</li>
			<li>Language recognition / translation</li>

		<h6>Content Creation</h6>
		<ul>
		<li>It’s <span class="thicker">not enough to digitize paper assignments</span>; the more interactive, pictures, colors, rich descriptions, the better.</li>

		<h5>Study Focus</h5>
	<p>
	As this was our initial testing session with users, our focus was broad and on <span class="thicker">general UI, layout and information architecture</span> as well as key features.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
		<h5>Research Questions</h5>
		<h6>UI and Design</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Is the overall layout of the notebook easy to use for a first timer without instructions or training?</li>
			<li>Do UI elements support recognition and ease of use?</li>
			<li>Are the language and icons appropriate and understood by a variety of age ranges?</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
	</p>
		<h6>Information Architecture</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Does the organization of the notebook support how users work in the real world?</li>
			<li>Does the notebook provide a findable and usable navigation?</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
	</p>
		<h6>Features</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Are users able to accomplish the tasks we outlined?</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
	</p>
	<h5>Test Scenarios</h5>
	<p>
		We developed our test scenarios to <span class="thicker">walk users through the main functions</span> of the app as determined in the wireframes.
	</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="thicker">Organization/navigation:</span> create a notebook, project, and sections</li>

		<li><span class="thicker">Features:</span> students and teachers <span class="thicker">enjoyed using personalization</span>, feedback, search, and content creation tools.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
	</p>
		<h6>Areas to Improve</h6>
		<ul>
		<li><span class="thicker">UI:</span> personalization menu icons and content creation toolbar</li>

	<div class="box">
		<p>
			Working on this project was personally rewarding for me as I was able to connect with several of the findings and values that came out of our project's research. I have always used notebooks to take notes, draw pictures and capture ideas. <span class="thicker">As a life-long learner, I understand the value of reflection</span> and the importance of being able to reference my previous work.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="thicker">Supporting "organization" within the app was more than just being able to find previous notes though</span>. The literature review highlighted that paper and digital notebooks were not being referenced, or reflected upon as often, believed mostly due to archiving standards not being followed by newer generations of scientists.
		</p>
		<p>
			The impact to this is a lack of insight, as findings aren't pulled forward from previous research, not making potential connections that could be something much more. This worries scientists and researchers who are seeing this critical step not being utilized; something many believe is the key to deeper insight.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was especially interesting to me as <span class="thicker">a researcher as I have thought about this challenge in my own work</span> and how I make connections to my previous projects.

	   This project was a learning process for me in a few other ways. It was my first time developing something where the user was a student and the first time the context was education. I was honored to work on this project knowing the potential would be for <span class="thicker">students to discover their own passions using a tool that was built just for them on their journey of learning</span>.
